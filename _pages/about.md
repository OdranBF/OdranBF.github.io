Welcome to my website! 

I am a pre-doctoral economic researcher at Trinity College Dublin, specifically within the Centre for Economic Policy and History ([CEPH](https://ceph.ie/)). My research interests include economic development, the economic usage and impact of natural resources, and economic geography. I am particularly interested in using advanced econometric methods to explore the relationships between the natural environment, regional development, and economic geography. My research aims to provide insights into how economic policies, disasters, and resources can drive sustainable development, with a focus on informing policy that addresses both growth and equity.
